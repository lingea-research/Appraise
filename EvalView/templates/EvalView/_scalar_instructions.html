    <p>Assess the translation quality on the 10-point scale using quality levels as follows:</p>


    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li><strong>Not acceptable (1-2)</strong>: The translation is misleading or incomprehensible, with severe meaning errors and broken language that make it unusable.</li>
      <li><strong>Borderline (3-4)</strong>: The text conveys some meaning but contains frequent errors and awkward phrasing; it requires heavy editing to be useful.</li>
      <li><strong>Acceptable (5-6)</strong>: The message is clear and mostly accurate, though minor issues in grammar or style remain; suitable with light to moderate editing.</li>
      <li><strong>Good (7-8)</strong>: The translation is accurate and fluent with only rare awkwardness; tone and style are appropriate, needing minimal polishing.</li>
      <li><strong>Excellent (9-10)</strong>: The text reads like a native-level, publication-ready piece: fully accurate, idiomatic, and stylistically polished.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that sentences in each paragraph can be separated by the <code>&lt;eos&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> tags for convenience and this should not impact your assessment.</p>
