      <li><strong>Very Good (9–10)</strong>: Complete meaning transfer. Sounds perfectly natural. (no or minimal proofreading)</li>
      <li><strong>Good (7–8)</strong>: Near‑complete transfer, minor inaccuracies. Mostly natural, minor awkwardness. (needs light proofreading)</li>
      <li><strong>Acceptable (5–6)</strong>: Main ideas conveyed but with noticeable inaccuracies or omissions. Uneven naturalness, awkward phrasing. (usable only after substantial revision)</li>
      <li><strong>Borderline (3–4)</strong>: Partial transfer; frequent misinterpretation or omission that confuses the message. Often unnatural. (requires major rewrite)</li>
      <li><strong>Not acceptable (1–2)</strong>: Violation of meaning; large portions mistranslated, missing, or incoherent. (unusable without complete retranslation)</li>
